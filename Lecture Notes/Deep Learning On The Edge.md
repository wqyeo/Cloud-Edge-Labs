## 2. Core Techniques for Efficient Deep Learning

### Pruning

- **Concept:**  
  Pruning involves reducing the number of weights (or connections) in a neural network. This can be done either within or across layers (neurons).
  
- **Pruning in Humans:**  
  Similar to how synapses (connections between neurons) are pruned in the brain over time.

- **How Pruning Works:**  
  - The goal is to minimize a cost function \( C(D | W) \), where \( D \) represents training data and \( W \) are the network parameters (weights).
  - By removing less important connections (weights), the network becomes more efficient.

- **Pruning Results:**  
  - Reduces the complexity of the network, leading to faster inference and lower resource usage.
  - Research has shown that pruning can significantly reduce the model size without sacrificing much accuracy.

### Quantization

- **Significance of Quantization:**  
  Quantization reduces the precision of the model’s weights and activations, allowing for reduced memory usage and computational cost.

- **Energy Savings with Lower Precision:**  
  - Precision (FP32, FP16, INT8) impacts the energy consumption of the operations:
    - **INT8** (8-bit integers) is significantly more energy-efficient than **FP32** (32-bit floating point).
  
- **How Quantization Works:**  
  Quantization involves converting the weights from floating-point values to lower bit representations (e.g., from FP32 to INT8). This reduces storage requirements and speeds up computation.

- **Types of Quantization:**
  - **Post-Training Quantization:**  
    Apply quantization to a pre-trained model.
  - **Quantization-Aware Training:**  
    Quantization is integrated during the model’s training process to make it aware of the reduced precision.

### Weight Sharing

- **Concept:**  
  Weight sharing compresses the model by forcing multiple weights to share the same value, reducing memory and storage requirements.

- **How Weight Sharing Works:**  
  - Weights that appear frequently are grouped together using a compression method such as **Huffman encoding**.
  - This results in fewer unique weights in the model, reducing its size and improving inference efficiency.

- **Results of Weight Sharing:**  
  Weight sharing can compress models significantly while maintaining most of their accuracy.

## 3. Advanced Approaches

### Knowledge Distillation

- **Concept:**  
  Knowledge distillation involves transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (teacher) to a smaller, more efficient model (student). This helps the student model perform better than a model trained from scratch.

- **Applications:**  
  It can be used in conjunction with pruning, quantization, and weight sharing to further enhance the performance and efficiency of edge models.
